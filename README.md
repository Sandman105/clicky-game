# clicky-game
Clicky memory game built with React.

<br>
<p>The Clicky GOT memory game, built with React and hosted on GitHub Pages will test the users memory, randomizing your favorite characters and trying to remember which ones you've already selected. Choose wisely.</p>
<br>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To play the Clicky GOT memory game, simply navigate to <a href="http://sandman105.github.io/clicky-game" rel="nofollow">Clicky-Game</a>, then click on any one of the characters to start. Next, choose a different character and so on, but keep in mind, which one you have chosen as they shuffle, they are deceptive. If you click the same character again, <strong>You Lose!</strong>. Once the game is over, just start again by clicking another character and see if you can be your high score. Good luck.</p>
